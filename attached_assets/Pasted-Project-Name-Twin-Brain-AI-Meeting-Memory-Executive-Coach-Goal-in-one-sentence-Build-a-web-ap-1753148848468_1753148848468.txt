Project Name: Twin Brain – AI Meeting Memory & Executive Coach

Goal in one sentence: Build a web app where I paste a transcript, click “Analyze,” and immediately receive structured meeting notes, action-item trackers, project files, and a meta-coach dashboard that I can refresh on demand.

⸻

	1.	Core User Stories (MVP)

	1.	Paste raw transcript text
	•	Single textarea plus “Analyze” button
	•	Accept up to ~100 kB of text
	2.	See Meeting Summary
	•	Output includes: title, date, participants, Key Takeaways, My Todos, Others’ Todos, Follow-Ups, Project Updates, Effectiveness Score (1–10), “What went well,” and “Areas to improve”
	3.	Persist data
	•	Store each transcript summary in SQLite
	•	Maintain one row per project with JSON history; auto-create or update when a project is mentioned
	4.	View Dashboard
	•	Home page cards: My Top Todos, Others’ Todos, Latest Meeting, Project List, Meta-Coach Insights
	5.	Trigger Daily Update
	•	“Sync Insights” button re-runs aggregation and refreshes dashboard
	6.	Open Project Detail
	•	Clicking a project shows running summary, decision log, open tasks, and timeline of related meetings

	2.	LLM Processing Pipeline

	•	System prompt: “You are an AI meeting assistant for Edward (CTO). Parse the raw transcript below…”
	•	Function-call schema (JSON returned by GPT):
{
“meeting”: {
“title”: “string”,
“date”: “YYYY-MM-DD”,
“participants”: [“string”]
},
“key_takeaways”: [“string”],
“action_items”: {
“edward”: [{“task”: “string”, “due”: “optional date”}],
“others”:  [{“task”: “string”, “owner”: “string”, “due”: “optional date”}]
},
“follow_ups”: [“string”],
“projects”: [
{
“name”: “string”,
“update”: “string”,
“status”: “open|hold|done”
}
],
“effectiveness”: {
“score”: 1-10,
“went_well”: [“string”],
“improve”:  [“string”]
}
}
	•	Effectiveness rubric: clarity of purpose, decisions made, action orientation, Edward’s leadership, time efficiency, follow-up readiness, net positive impact.
	•	Meta-Coach aggregation: rolling averages, strengths, opportunities, pitfalls, meeting stats.

	3.	Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
Styling: TailwindCSS
State: React Query
Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
Database: SQLite using SQLModel
LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o (API key via .env)
Auth: none (single-user local)

⸻

	4.	File / Folder Blueprint

main.py               (FastAPI app & routes)

	5.	API Endpoints

POST /analyze        Body: { “raw_transcript”: “…” } → parses with GPT, stores, returns JSON
GET  /dashboard      Returns dashboard object including meta-coach data
POST /sync           Triggers aggregation of meta-coach stats
GET  /project/{id}   Returns full project history and open tasks

⸻

	6.	UI Flow

	•	Navbar: Dashboard | New Meeting | Projects
	•	New Meeting page: large textarea, “Analyze” button, results panel appears below
	•	Dashboard page:
Left column – My Top Todos, Others’ Todos
Right column – Latest Meeting Summary (with Effectiveness badge), Project List, Meta-Coach Insights, “Sync Insights” button
	•	Project Detail page: timeline of updates plus open tasks list

⸻

	7.	Non-Functional Requirements

	•	Performance: return summary in under 8 s for <= 10k words
	•	Reliability: graceful handling of LLM timeouts or failures
	•	Security: API key stored server-side via .env, never exposed to client
	•	Logging: basic request/error logs to console
	•	Tests: unit tests for openai_client and analytics

⸻

	8.	Stretch Goals (hold for later)

	•	Slack slash-command for transcript intake
	•	Natural-language search across meetings
	•	Daily email digest at 07:00 local time
	•	Sentiment trend graph across meetings

⸻

Deliverable: A runnable Replit project that lets me paste a transcript, click “Analyze,” and instantly see structured results plus a living dashboard—only setup required is pasting my OpenAI key and hitting Run.
